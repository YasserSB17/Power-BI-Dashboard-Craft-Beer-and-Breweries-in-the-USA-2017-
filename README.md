Craft Beer and Breweries in the USA (2017)


🎯 Project Objective

This project analyzes craft beers and breweries in the USA using data from 2017. The goal is to explore beer styles, alcohol content, and brewery distributions to provide insights into the craft beer industry.


🔄 Workflow & Methodology


1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preprocessing


Dataset Overview:

The dataset contains information about various craft beers and breweries, including their location, beer styles, and alcohol content.

Key Variables:

Beer Name – Name of the beer.

Style – Category of the beer (e.g., American IPA, Saison, Porter).

ABV (Alcohol by Volume) – Alcohol percentage in the beer.

IBU (International Bitterness Unit) – Measures bitterness of the beer.

Brewery Name – Name of the brewery.

City & State – Location of the brewery.

Total Beers per Brewery – Number of different beers produced by each brewery.

Data Processing:

Missing numerical values were imputed using median values.

Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding.

Standardized numerical features for better comparability.


2️⃣ Descriptive Analysis & Insights


Key findings from the exploratory analysis:

The most popular beer style is American IPA, making up 17.59% of all beers.

There are 558 breweries producing 2,410 unique beers in the dataset.

Some breweries produce a higher variety of beers, showcasing diversification in offerings.

Alcohol content (ABV) varies significantly, with some styles having consistently higher ABV levels.


3️⃣ Statistical Analysis & Trends


Beer Popularity: Certain styles like American Pale Ale and American Porter are also widely produced.

Geographical Trends: Breweries are spread across different states, with notable hubs in beer production.

Brewery Size: Some breweries focus on a small number of specialized beers, while others have extensive offerings.

🚀 Business Impact & Decision-Making

📈 Strategic Insights for Breweries

Style Trends: Breweries can focus on producing popular beer styles based on market demand.

Competitive Landscape: Understanding brewery distributions helps identify key brewing hubs.

Consumer Preferences: ABV and IBU trends provide insights into evolving consumer taste.

🛠️ Future Improvements

Expand the dataset with more recent data to analyze industry growth.
